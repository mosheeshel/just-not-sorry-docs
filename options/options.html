    We're Just NOT Sorry! Let's stop qualifying our message and
    diminishing our voice. Inspired by the writings of Tara Mohr
    and others, this Chrome Extension for Gmail will warn you
    when you use words or phrases that undermine your message.
    Words will be underlined for correction with additional
    information about how using the phrase is perceived.
    (Don't worry, the underline won't get sent as part of your
    email if you decide to ignore it.)
